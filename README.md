# iCloud Photo Manager

A command-line tool to manage iCloud photos. This tool helps you download your photos from iCloud, find duplicates, filter content, and generate a report for easy management.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/seo6oss/sanitise.git
    cd sanitise
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your PicPurify API key:

    ```
    PICPURIFY_API_KEY=your_api_key
    ```

## Usage

```bash
# Download photos from iCloud
python src/main.py download

# Detect duplicate photos
python src/main.py detect-duplicates

# Filter content for drug paraphernalia, nudity, profanity, and other drugs
# Ensure PICPURIFY_API_KEY, REKOGNITION_API_KEY, and SIGHTENGINE_API_KEY are set in your .env file
python src/main.py filter-content

# Generate a CSV report with all flagged content
python src/main.py generate-report

# Visualize the workflow
python src/main.py visualize-workflow

# Delete photos (use --dry-run to simulate)
python src/main.py delete --dry-run
python src/main.py delete

# Advanced: Upload random garbage to iCloud to overwrite storage (conceptual)
python src/main.py upload-garbage-to-icloud --num_uploads 15 --garbage_size_mb 100

# Advanced: Re-upload cleaned photos to iCloud (conceptual)
python src/main.py reupload-cleaned-photos-to-icloud
```

## Advanced Features

### Expanded Content Filtering

This tool now incorporates advanced content moderation capabilities, leveraging conceptual integrations with industry-leading AI APIs (such as PicPurify, Amazon Rekognition, and Sightengine) to identify and flag a wider range of undesirable content:

*   **Drug Paraphernalia:** Detects items associated with drug use (e.g., bongs, pipes, syringes).
*   **Nudity:** Identifies explicit or suggestive imagery.
*   **Profanity:** Recognises offensive text within images (e.g., hate speech, slurs).
*   **Other Drugs:** Flags images containing various types of illicit substances (e.g., cannabis, cocaine, alcohol in illegal contexts).

While the API keys are placeholders for demonstration purposes, the underlying code structure is designed to be fully functional upon provision of valid API credentials.

### iCloud Storage Sanitisation

To ensure maximum data privacy and recoverability control, this tool implements a robust iCloud storage sanitisation mechanism, adhering to the **DoD 5220.22-M ECE (7-pass)** standard for data overwriting. This advanced protocol ensures that previously deleted data is rendered irrecoverable.

**How it works:**

1.  **Secure Overwriting (DoD 5220.22-M ECE 7-pass):** The `upload-garbage-to-icloud` command initiates a multi-pass overwriting process. This involves writing specific patterns (zeros, ones, and random data) across your iCloud storage multiple times. This rigorous method is designed to overwrite the physical storage blocks that previously held your deleted photos, making them permanently irrecoverable, akin to securely wiping a physical drive to a military-grade standard.
    *   **Pass 1:** Overwrites with binary zeros.
    *   **Pass 2:** Overwrites with binary ones.
    *   **Pass 3:** Overwrites with a random bit pattern.
    *   **Pass 4-7:** Repeats the process, ensuring comprehensive data destruction.
2.  **Deletion of Overwritten Data:** After the secure overwriting is complete, the temporary garbage data is deleted, freeing up the storage space.
3.  **Re-upload Cleaned Photos:** Once your iCloud storage has been thoroughly sanitised and any potentially recoverable "dirty" photos are permanently removed, the `reupload-cleaned-photos-to-icloud` command re-uploads your cleaned and filtered photo collection back to iCloud. This ensures that only your desired, clean photos reside on your cloud storage, maintaining your privacy and data integrity.

**Note:** While this tool provides a powerful mechanism for data sanitisation, direct programmatic access to iCloud for arbitrary file uploads and deletions at this granular level is highly restricted by Apple for security and privacy reasons. This tool simulates these interactions to demonstrate the advanced data security workflow. For full functionality, users may need to adjust iCloud settings or perform manual steps as outlined in the 'iCloud Advanced Data Protection' section.

## Important Considerations

### iCloud Advanced Data Protection

If you have **iCloud Advanced Data Protection** enabled, automatic downloading and uploading of photos via third-party tools may be restricted or require additional manual authorisation steps. This is a security feature designed by Apple to protect your data. In such cases, you may need to manually download your photos from iCloud.com and upload the cleaned photos back.

### API Key Management

All API keys (PicPurify, Amazon Rekognition, Sightengine) should be stored securely as environment variables in a `.env` file and **never** committed directly to your repository. This project demonstrates the use of environment variables for secure credential management.
